# Random-utils

A collection of different utilities and scripts not important enough to deserve their own repos.

## Included scripts

`seqimagerename.sh`  
A script for sequential image renaming. Useful for sorting out huge amounts of inconsistently named images.  
`tarsplit.py`  
A script for splitting a tar archive (compressed or not) into smaller pieces with a user-defined number of files inside each split archive.
